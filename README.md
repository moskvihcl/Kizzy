## What's new in this fork

All additions live in the **Experimental RPC** screen and on the home screen.

### ⭐ Platform spoofer
- Choose which platform your presence connects from — **Desktop, Web, Android, iOS, Xbox, Playstation, VR** (ported from the platforms used by Equicord's platformSpoofer).
- Works at the gateway `IDENTIFY` level (client status), so it is correctly picked up by plugins like **platformindicators**.
- Applies **live** — the service restarts itself, no manual toggle needed.

### ⭐ Custom Application ID (own icon)
- Selector **Built-in / Custom**. Built-in keeps the default icon; Custom reveals a field where you paste your own Discord **Application ID**, so the activity shows **your** icon and name.

### ⭐ Extra template placeholders
In addition to the original ones, with autocomplete:
- `{{media_album}}`, `{{media_album_artist}}`, `{{media_duration}}`, `{{media_writer}}`, `{{media_composer}}`
- `{{battery}}` — battery percentage
- `{{playback}}` — playback state (▶ / ⏸)

### ⭐ Timestamp mode selector
- **Media / App (default)** — timestamps from the current track/app.
- **Same as current time of day** — Discord shows the current time as elapsed (e.g. at 15:30 → shows "15:30 elapsed"). Same logic as Vencord's customRPC.
- **Custom** — type raw **Start / End Timestamp (in milliseconds)** yourself.

### ⭐ Home screen redesign
- Feature cards are now a vertical stack of full-width cards.
- **On/off toggle switches on every card**, so Media / Custom / Experimental RPC can be started and stopped directly from the home screen.

### ⭐ Gateway resilience (ported from [YuuzuTH/Kizzy](https://github.com/YuuzuTH/Kizzy))
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff on any unexpected disconnect.
- Resumes the session when possible; falls back to fresh identify after 3 failed attempts.
- Fatal close codes (4004, 4010–4014) still stop permanently.
- 60-second cap on presence-update waits (was an infinite loop).
- Detection loop is now wrapped in try/catch — a single network error no longer kills app-switch detection until manual restart.
- App-switch polling: **2 s** (was 5 s).
- Fix: switching between two enabled apps now updates the presence immediately.

### Fixes
- Fixed crash on **"Share log"** (FileProvider authority now follows the package id).
- Fixed crashes when switching RPC features from the home screen.

## System Requirements
- OS: Android 8.1 through 16
- RAM: 3 GB minimum

## Download
Grab the latest signed `app-release.apk` from the [**Releases**](../../releases/latest) page.

**Kizzy Enhanced** uses the package id **`com.my.kizzy.enhanced`**, so it installs alongside the original Kizzy if you have it.

> [!WARNING]
> This app uses the Discord Gateway connection. Use it at your own risk.

## Build
> Prerequisites: Android Studio, and familiarity with Gradle, Kotlin, and Jetpack Compose.

```console
git clone https://github.com/milliarderr/Kizzy-Enhanced.git
```
Open the project in Android Studio, import it, then Build and Run. Release builds are produced automatically by the **Build Release Apk** GitHub Actions workflow.
